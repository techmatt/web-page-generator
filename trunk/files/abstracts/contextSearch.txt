Large corpora of 3D models, such as Google 3D Warehouse, are now becoming available on the web. It is possible to search these databases using a keyword search. This makes it possible for designers to easily include existing content into new scenes. In this paper, we describe a method for context-based search of 3D scenes. We first downloaded a large set of scene graphs from Google 3D Warehouse. These scene graphs were segmented into individual objects. We also extracted tags from the names of the models. Given the object shape, tags, and spatial relationship between pairs of objects, we can predict the strength of a relationship between a candidate model and an existing object in the scene. Using this function, we can perform context-based queries. The user specifies a region in the scene they are modeling using a 3D bounding box, and the system returns a list of related objects. We show that context-based queries perform better than keyword queries alone, and that without any keywords our algorithm still returns a relevant set of models.
