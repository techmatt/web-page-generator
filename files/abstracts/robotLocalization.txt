We present an algorithm for geometric mapping from range scans captured over significant spatial extents and augmented with calibrated images. Because the input range scans and images are taken over a large area in complex environments, significant errors may be introduced during their calibration and we present several techniques to account for this. The output is a textured mesh that can then answer location queries given input images taken in the scanned area. In the query phase, we use a hidden markov model to localize a camera in the scanned environment by matching it against the geometric map. We present the results of our work on a dataset gathered in a very cluttered environment.
