We present DiagSplit, a highly parallel algorithm for adaptively tessellating displaced parametric surfaces into high-quality, crack free micropolygon meshes. DiagSplit modifies the split-dice tessellation algorithm to make splits using non-isoparametric cuts in the surface's parametric domain, and uses a dicing scheme that supports unique tessellation factors for each subpatch edge. Splitting and edge tessellation factor computations use only information local to subpatch edges. These modifications allow all subpatches generated by DiagSplit to be processed independently without introducing T-junctions or mesh cracks and without incurring the tessellation overhead of binary dicing. We demonstrate that DiagSplit produces output that is better (in terms of image quality and number of micropolygons produced) than existing parallel tessellation schemes, and as good as highly adaptive, but hard to parallelize, split-dice implementations.
